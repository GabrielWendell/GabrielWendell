## 🧪 What I work on
[![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=YourUsername&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/GabrielWendell)

I am a Physics PhD student working on **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** and **Machine Learning** applied to complex physical systems.  
Most of my research lives at the intersection of:

- **Astronomical scale**  
  - Gravitational-wave detection at low SNR  
  - Asteroseismology and stellar structure  
  - Galaxy morphology and large-scale structure

- **Mesoscopic scale**  
  - Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) & fluid dynamics  
  - Nonlinear instabilities (Kelvin–Helmholtz, Rayleigh–Taylor)  
  - Low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz, Rössler, Chua, etc.)

- **Microscopic scale**  
  - Magnetic materials & Barkhausen noise  
  - Condensed matter systems and phase transitions  
  - Quantum information and entanglement structure

Across these domains, I like to ask:  
> **What can topology “see” in data that classical statistics cannot?**

## 📚 Selected publications

Some of my scientific work (see my ORCID/ResearchGate for a complete list):

- **Computational Modeling of a Star: A Theoretical and Numerical Approach** – *Revista Brasileira de Ensino de Física*  
- **Generalization to d-dimensions of a fermionic path integral for exact enumeration of polygons on hypercubic lattices** – *Scientific Reports (Nature)*
- **The limb darkening via transit modeling and Bayesian inference** – *Revista Brasileira de Ensino de Física*  

I am particularly interested in papers and projects that connect **mathematical structures** (topology, geometry, stochastic processes) with **observable physical phenomena**.

## 🎓 Teaching & outreach

I enjoy teaching as much as research, and often design materials that are both **mathematically rigorous** and **code-driven**:

- **PET.py notebooks (PET–Física / UFRN)**  
  - Extensive collection of notebooks on astronomy, fluids, quantum mechanics, and dynamical systems.
- **Minicourse – Uma breve introdução ao Machine Learning (PET–Física / UFRN)**  
  - 5-day course covering supervised & unsupervised learning, tensor computation, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Minicourse – Introdução ao Python para Engenharia Química (UFRN)**  
  - Hands-on workshop on Python for scientific and engineering applications.

Whenever possible, I publish the materials here on GitHub so they can be reused, remixed, and improved.

## 🧰 Toolbox

I work mainly in the **Python scientific ecosystem**, with a focus on tools that scale to real research workloads:

- **Languages**  
  - Python, a bit of C/C++ when needed for performance, Markdown/LaTeX for documentation.

- **Numerical & scientific computing**  
  - NumPy, SciPy, pandas, SciPy stack for ODE/PDE solving, optimization, and signal processing.

- **Machine learning & deep learning**  
  - scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, classical ML pipelines, and experiment workflows with explicit configs and reproducible seeds.

- **Data & visualization**  
  - Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly/Dash/Streamlit for interactive dashboards, Jupyter/nbconvert for reproducible reports.

- **Dev & tooling**  
  - Git/GitHub, Vim/Neovim, VS Code, Linux environments, and simple automation for pipelines.

I care a lot about **clean project structure**, **version control**, and **reproducibility** (configs, seeds, environment files, and clear documentation).

## 🌱 Beyond the code

- 🌌 I like to think about **physics “across scales”** – from quantum scales to astronomical scales.  
- 🌺 A PhD student working with TDA & ML applied to physics and who loves flowers.   
- 💬 I’m always happy to discuss physics, topology, ML, and research workflows – feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or reach out.
